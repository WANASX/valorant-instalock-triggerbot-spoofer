## Overview

Valorant Trigger Bot & Spoofer is designed to assist players by:
- **Auto Trigger:** Automatically firing when an enemy is on your crosshair.
- **Insta Lock:** Instantly locking onto the target during the operator picking phase.
- **Advanced Code Spoofing:** Using AST-based transformation to completely randomize function names, variable names, and code structure on every run.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Utilizing CUDA and PyTorch for dramatically improved detection performance on compatible systems.

The tool features a user-friendly interface (built with PyQt5) that allows you to adjust settings such as field of view (FOV), shooting delay, and other performance parameters.

## Features

- **Auto Trigger with Dynamic Delay:**  
  When an enemy is detected on your crosshair, the bot simulates a left mouse click with configurable random delay between min/max values for more human-like behavior.
  
- **GPU-Accelerated Detection:**  
  Utilizes CUDA and PyTorch for high-performance color detection, with automatic fallback to CPU if needed.
  
- **Insta Lock:**  
  Quickly locks onto a target during the operator selection phase, with clear warning about potential ban risks.
  
- **Advanced Code Spoofing:**  
  Uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformation to completely randomize function and variable names, adds random spacing, comments, and no-op code to make detection nearly impossible.
  
- **Smart Acceleration:**  
  Automatically benchmarks and selects the best processing method (GPU or CPU) based on your hardware.
  
- **Improved Interface:**  
  Enhanced GUI with thematic options, better settings organization, and clear performance indicators.

## New in Version 3.0

- **AST-based Code Transformation:** Complete rewrite of the spoofer to use Python's AST for robust code transformation.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Added CUDA and PyTorch support for dramatically improved detection performance.
- **Smart Benchmarking:** Automatically tests and selects the best acceleration method for your system.
- **Randomized Shooting Delay:** Configure min/max shooting delay values for more human-like behavior.
- **Block Movement Option:** Option to automatically release movement keys (WASD) while shooting for better accuracy.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Improved error handling, configuration validation, and compatibility checks.
- **Better UI:** Redesigned interface with theme options and better visualization of performance.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Python Version:** 3.9+  
- **Dependencies:**  
  - PyQt5  
  - opencv-python (with CUDA support recommended)
  - numpy  
  - pytorch (with CUDA support recommended)
  - pyautogui  
  - pypiwin32  
  - bettercam  
  - astor (for code transformation)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/WANASX/valorant-instalock-triggerbot-spoofer.git
cd valorant-instalock-triggerbot-spoofer
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```
pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui pywin32 PyQt5 bettercam torch astor
```
## Usage

1. **Run as Administrator:**  
   Run the Main.bat file with administrator privileges for proper mouse event simulation.

2. **Configure Settings:**  
   Launch the application using Main.bat. Use the GUI to adjust settings such as FOV, min/max shooting delay, and GPU acceleration options.

3. **Start the TriggerBot:**  
   The TriggerBot is enabled by default. Use the configured hotkey (Alt by default) to activate triggering when enemies are detected.

4. **InstaLock Agent:**  
   Press F5 before entering agent selection to automatically lock your chosen agent.
   
5. **Code Spoofing:**  
   Every time you run the application, it generates a uniquely randomized version with transformed function names, variable names, and code structure.
   
6. **Enemy Highlight Color:**
   For best detection, go to Valorant settings and change enemy highlight color to Yellow (protanopia).

## File Structure

- **main.bat:** Launcher script that runs the application with administrator privileges.
- **menu.py:** Contains the core UI and trigger bot logic.
- **main.py:** Advanced spoofer that transforms menu.py using AST and generates a unique version.
- **temp/**: Directory where obfuscated files are generated.
- **config.json:** Configuration file storing user settings.

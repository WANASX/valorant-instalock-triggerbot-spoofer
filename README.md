## Overview

Valorant Trigger Bot & Spoofer is designed to assist players by:
- **Auto Trigger:** Automatically firing when an enemy is on your crosshair.
- **Insta Lock:** Instantly locking onto the target during the operator picking phase.
- **Code Spoofing:** Obfuscating and randomizing the internal code on every run to make each execution unique.

The tool features a user-friendly interface (built with PyQt5) that allows you to adjust settings such as field of view (FOV) and shooting delay.

- **Insta Lock:**  
  Quickly locks onto a target during the operator selection phase.
  
- **Unique Code Spoofing:**  
  On every run, the tool obfuscates its internal logic and generates a unique file to help bypass static signature detection.
  
- **GUI Configuration:**  
  Easily configure settings like FOV and shooting delay via the graphical user interface.

3. **Start the Bot:**  
   Press F5 to initiate scanning. When an enemy is detected on your crosshair, the bot fires automatically.

4. **Code Spoofing:**  
   Each run, the spoofer obfuscates the internal code (except for the UI design) and generates a uniquely named file in the `temp/` folder.
   
6. **Enemy Highlight Color**
   Go to Valorant settings and change enemy highlight color to Yellow (protanopia)

## File Structure
